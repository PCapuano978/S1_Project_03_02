style rules that would conflict by either being more specific, or stated after this one. */

within a body element and as such overules the previous selector and only applies the effects here. */

what would happen if a comma would be absent where it would effect all "h2"s nested in "h1" elements. */
/* Navigation Styles */

direct child of the former element, in this case all unordered lists directly under the "nav" tags */

nested within the "nav" tags by being that specific shade of blue, wether they've been visted, or not. */

nav a:hover {
    color: rgb(212, 35, 35);

/* In a similar vein to the last elements, these ones effect links nested within "nav" tags by
changing to the stated shade of red when the mouse hovers over them, or they are clicked. */

this case they are told to set every other "h2" and "p" element within an aside with the ID
of "tour_itinerary" to be an RBG value that corrilates to a shade of dark green. */

    color: rgb(81, 95, 175)
}

/* Pseudo elements here function a similar purpose, but this time they are told to effect even
items instead which combinded with the last style rule creates a pattern where every odd heading and
paragraph has a dark green color, where the rest of the even headings and paragraphs are blue.  */

/* Blockquote Styles */

/* By setting the general padding to "2.5px 10px" it sets the top and bottom paddings to what was
stated in the first value while then making the left and right sides equal to the second value. */
